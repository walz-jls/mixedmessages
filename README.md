ATC Instruction Generator

***

This script generates a random Air Traffic Control instruction, as would be issued by an operator to the pilot of an aircraft.  
  
  The rules are as follows :  
  1. It should take the callsign of an aircraft as input.  
  2. It should choose up to 3 out of 4 possible instructions to issue (heading change, level change, speed adjustement, frequency change).  
  3. It should get random levels/heading/speed/frequency values and tendancies (climb or descent, left or right turn, etc...)  
  4. The instructions should always come in this order : heading instruction, altitude change, speed change and next frequency to contact.
